I've been created by **Helmerz** (_http://www.helmerz.xyz_) for educational purposes

Here's what commands I can do right now:```
!quit (Bot-admins only)
!roll (get a random number between 0 and 100)
!RemoveMessages [amount] (removes the amount of messages you give it to, bot-admins only)
!picture [tag] (downloads a random picture from imgur.com with your desired tag)
!picture random (gives you a random picture freshly posted to imgur)
!coinflip (I'll flip a coin and tell the outcome, what did you expect?)
!MessageMe (I will send you a message)
!help (this command)```
osu! integration:```
Paste a map's link to get some data from the map
Paste an user's profile link to get some data about the user
```
You can also talk to me by first tagging me and then what do you want to say! (Example: <@397454492108324864> How was your day?)
