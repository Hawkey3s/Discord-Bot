WARNING: THIS PROGRAM DOWNLOADS PICTURES FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES WHERE YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT YOU GET. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE ABOUT WHAT YOU GET IN ANY WAY USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Discord is a free messaging app used mostly by gamers.
There are a lot of bots already made for it, but this one is mine.
My bot uses the discord.py library which can be found here: http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/

My bot can post pictures to the chat (with a specific tag, ecchi stuff or gifs etc.) and it also has a built-in chatbot so if you get lonely you can talk to the bot. And there's a lot more.

You can also troll/annoy your friends with some of the commands.

### Usage/installation
If you're using this source as a base for your bot, insert your API keys to the auth.ini file.

Then just install the correct packages with `pip` (to figure out which packages you need to install, just read the source a bit).

You also may want to change a few things from the source (such as the ID in checks.py).

Also worth mentioning that I made this bot to work with Python 3.6.6. It could work with other versions, but that's something for you to figure out.

You can see the available commands by ~help to any channel that the bot can see and can send messages to.
