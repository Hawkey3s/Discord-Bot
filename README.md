WARNING: THIS PROGRAM DOWNLOADS PICTURES FROM IMGUR.COM WHICH IS AN EXTERNAL SOURCE WHERE YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT YOU GET. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE ABOUT WHAT YOU GET IN ANY WAY USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

My Discord bot.
Uses the discordpy library which can be found here: http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Discord is a free messaging app used mostly by gamers.
It also has an API that you can use with bot-accounts that you can make for free.

My bot can post pictures to the chat (with a specific tag or just post a random picture) and it also has a built-in chatbot so if you get lonely you can talk to the bot.
You can also troll your friends with some of the commands.

To setup your bot, insert your API keys to the auth.ini file and then just starting Ter_kaBot.py and adding the bot to your server.
You can use the commands by writing a command (example: !help) to any channel that the bot can see and can send messages to.

I will add A LOT of stuff in the future
